I spent the entire day punching holes and sewing the pennies onto the shirt and had crazy carpal tunnel in my hand by the end of the day.

The band is called \"Feral Romance\" so I found an image of a scary, feral looking cat and made my first stencil out of that. It took a solid hour to cut, but was well worth it.

She had texted me earlier that week about how important it was that I come. But she posted the lyrics to the song a few days earlier, with some lyrics referencing specific things I told her when we had our breaking up conversation. The song was called \"Bitch Boy\". Lol. So embarrasing. I made some merch for her too! So embarrassing. So my shirt of the day just had a little boy watering some flowers on the front, and on the back there is a big red target, like through the scope of a gun. You can put the pieces together. I didn't even realize how angry I was until I got there and saw her. We hugged and talked outside for a few minutes as we shared a joint. Some other guys there with us tried to sell me shrooms. Then I went to give the pieces I made to this other guy who was running the merch for the show. He was a dick, ignoring me and treating me like I was inferior. It wasn't the first time he'd brushed me off like that either, and I decided I was done being treated like that. I went up to R and told her I was leaving. She said she thought that was a good idea, and squeezed my wrist. I squeezed her wrist back, and threw it away. Then I walked out and never saw her again. Down the street, light and music shone out from a ground-floor church. I pulled open the heavy door, and a woman asked if I knew that the service was a Pentecostal Dominican mass, fully in Spanish. I said yes, I wanted to enter. I found a chair near the back, and sat through 45 minutes of beautiful music and prayers. I watched, listened, and cried. Throughout the service a toddler crawled around, babbling baby noises and banging on a tambourine he had found. I walked out probably just a few minutes before the mass was ending, and went home where I demanded that A go out with me. We went to Bossa Nova, where we got drunk, danced, and asked strangers for poppers, before capping the night with some OMG Burger Pizza.",

Walking a mile in the freezing cold to get to the show, I screamed out lyrics to \"simmer down\", \"i'm fine\", \"bored\", and others off FousheÃ©'s new album.

I typically didn't take anyone's ideas or suggestions because I wanted the project to be fully my own, but her idea was just too good and I decided to rock with it.

This week involved a lot of change. For my first projected shirt, I painted my little sister C's bed.

This shirt ended up being somewhat iconic in my life because it really blew up on the clock app, reaching 1.8 million views. I was happy to get attention, but at the same time it sucked having this be the one that blew up. I felt like I was the face of the strike in a way that was kind of scary. I didn't want everyone who I went to school with and used TikTok to know who I was and what I was doing. This day I had a great time though because E's studio class had an exhibition and I went with my friends and got pretty wine drunk and had fun looking at art before leaving my friends to go to my final journalism class.",

I wish I spent more time in that area of Prague. It looks cooler and more artist-friendly. That night, we had a farewell dinner with all of the professors and guides. I ate my final goulash and drank some of my final Czech beers. I don't think we went out that night. Everyone except for me had to wake up early for their flights home the next morning.",

Finally, being alone in that dorm room, I felt a rush of anxiety and sadness. I don't think my time in Prague was all I initially imagined it would be. I loved all of my time there, but was left with this profound feeling that I had failed to achieve what I had initially set out to accomplish being there, despite entering with no actual goals with my time. I was sad that my time in Prague so quickly came to a close and even more sad that I didn't enjoy it more. I made my way to a hotel next to the airport to stay in for the night before my flight in the morning. At the hotel, I planned to airbrush and make the most out of my final hours in Prague but I ended up smoking the rest of the weed I had bought and kind of just doing nothing and crashing early. I did get a nice dinner though and got to have my final Pilsner Urquell, which is the best beer ever made.",

They were for style, but more for some sort of spiritual protection. I had become infatuated with totems of all sorts over the past year, beginning with rocks and gems that gave you some sort of astrological powers or whatever until I got tired of those and they left my life when I needed them to. Then, new totems came into my life at different points and served as reminders of who I am. They grounded me. I'm not even sure if totems are the right word but either way its important to me to have little trinkets or things that I can look at to center myself.

It was really hitting me how crazy I was to do this whole thing and really hitting me how I had done it and yeah I wanted to make a silly little shirt to represent that. Again referencing the internet culture, as well as the motivational posters that would hang up in schools back in the early 2000s, I made this shirt that I really liked. This day I went to S's midtown apartment to finish up our group project, and then met up with friends from my old journalism class to go get food in Chinatown.",

"description": "A few days prior, as I waited for the subway, I watched as a woman washed the graffiti off of a wall. Processes of the removal of art are really interesting to me, along with the cyclical nature of restoration and decay. It kind of falls in line with the \"wet paint\" shirt. Also the aspect of storytelling is fun to get into whenever I have the chance.",

"description": "It was finals week in my last semester of school and I was swamped all day so I ended up just making this one really quick in like 20 minutes at the end of the day. I still really like it though. That fish dude looks super chill and I feel like a super chill guy wearing it. I also made four shirts for my group's project that we wore for our final presentation, even though I felt super corny doing that but it was cool.",

"description": "I know I say it a lot but this is probably some of the best work I have ever done, and one of my favorite pieces I have ever made. First, in the morning, my group gave our final presentation for our senior capstone project. The presentation went incredibly well, and I was finally done with school. A few days earlier, when I was meeting at S's midtown apartment to finalize the presentation, I came across a long line of busses waiting to pick up kids from school and snapped photos of all of them. Later, I photoshopped all the busses together and spent a solid three hours painting this shirt. My friend called it a \"biblically accurate angel\" which I think is very fitting. That night, I went out drinking with S and E from my group project. We hopped around to a few different bars, finally getting the chance to spend time together outside of the context of school, and made our way to the Hudson river shore as the night turned to day. I watched the sunrise through the window of the M train moving across the Williamsburg Bridge.",

"description": "I spent most of this day recovering from the previous night before going on a date near the end of the day. My date helped me out with the idea for this shirt because I showed her my idea of basketball Mario but wasn't sure what player to tie it to and her Manu suggestion was perfect. I got home from that pretty late and just made the shirt and fell asleep so I could get up early the next day to go shoot this cannabis parade so I could write a story about it for my journalism class.",

"description": "This was a crazy long day, started off by leaving the house still underrested to go shoot this NYC cannabis parade so I could submit something and not fail my journalism class. After shooting and getting a good amount of interviews at the parade, I met up with my friends for a day at Prospect Park. I had gotten a free shirt at the cannabis parade and wore it to not stain my white shirt on the grass. It was my first time wearing a non-white t-shirt all year. We brought beers and shrooms and had such a fun day in the sun, running around and playing, and eventually all taking our shoes off and walking eight miles around the park as the sun started to come down from the sky and we found ourselves skipping stones by the lake. Then, we walked to Z's apartment as the sun set and went out for tacos near her place before making our way home late at night. I was exhausted and had zero ideas for what to make, but made this shirt with A and A from earlier in the day as they both slept in the room next to me.",

"description": "I went on a morning walk to secure my daily caffeine intake and saw this beautiful classic car that I snapped some photos of. I painted two of them to make the composition more interesting, and it reminded me of that I Think You Should Leave skit with Bob Odenkirk and the classic cars. Later in the day I went on another date. We smoked weed and I showed her how to airbrush but we weren't really feeling each other and that was the last time I saw her.",

"description": "Down the block from me there was this busted up Honda Oddessy that was always parked in the same spot, and I liked painting the cars on the previous day's shirt. Every shirt builds upon the previous one, with how I see it. It was a wild feeling being in these final ten days of the project. Rather than the stress involved with making a shirt day after day, each day was marked with a twinge of melancholy without any of the anxiety. There was a sense of catharsis as well. Calm.",

"description": "Again contrasting with the previous day's shirt, I painted a kiddie Benz that I saw while walking down the street a few days earlier. This day marked one week left of the project. It was a strange feeling. I no longer felt any sort of overwhelming high or low from making a shirt that I liked, or just making a shirt that I knew I could make. At this point the shirts were more of an afterthought to my upcoming show to display all of them. It was still so freeing to make the shirts though. I was doing what I loved.",

"description": "This was a fun one to make, and one that I'm really glad exists in the world. Towards the end of the project I took focus on what lies at the root of my work as a whole, which is finding artistic inspiration in everything and anything around you, especially the mundane. Certain things that we see every day become complete afterthoughts, yet hold intrinsic value that is not uncovered until we as artists reveal it. I walk by that BP pretty much every day and never thought twice about it beyond the fact that it's rare to see gas stations in New York. I thought about adding more imagery from the gas station, but I think it's pretty cool with just the sign, looking almost like a humanoid figure.",

"description": "This was such a long day. I had the final class of my college career with my final project group and we continued to hang out until 4 after our 9AM class. We were waiting on the news on whether or not our group would be selected to be on the panel of the BBA Symposium, which was a really big deal to us. Eventually we split, still nervous about the decision. I wandered through Manhattan for a bit, got a decent vegan burger, and snapped a bunch of photos of stop lights before hopping on the subway. I got the call from S and E while walking home and was ecstatic, we did it. I thought about collaging the stoplight photos together but then just went with the one.",

"description": "This was the fourth from final shirt, and my friend J was in town visiting. For this shirt I found an old photo I took of a bulldozer and stretched it out to be nice and tall. I look back on some of these shirts and think it would have been cool if I added more color, but at the time I was focused on just getting the shirt done with for the day because I had other stuff to do. I met T and J at Tompkins and then ran into my friends E and S there before going out drinking w T and J. I got super tired that night and fell asleep waiting for the subway. I must have had some sort of luck on my side that kept my phone that was sitting on my lap from getting stolen.",

Back to my roots in a way, I was just trying to do something that no one had really seen before and be funny. That night, we went out to I's birthday party and it was nice getting a bunch of reactions out of people.",

I kind of messed up the portrait but its of me and my mom laying in the grass. That night I went over to H's and had a good time hanging out up on the roof with her and G and A. G and A bet me to do a cannonball into the kiddie pool roof up there so I stripped down to my underwear and made a quick $60. I went to bed anxious that night, thinking about the fact that I would wake up the next day and make the last shirt.",

"description": "I decided it would be best to keep things simple with this final shirt. I hung the blank shirt up and spent about half an hour just looking at it. It was a surreal feeling. It only took me five minutes to make this one. I got chills as I put it on. There was a strange sense of bliss. As I rode the subway over to the city I spent extra time looking up at the city and the people around me. Energy buzzed through my body. But I had to turn my focus towards the BBA Symposium happening that night. The symposium was a graduation celebration and final showcase of everyone's work, a true conclusion. I had no idea the days would line up like this when I started the project. That night, my group was one of the few to have our project displayed to hundreds more people and have the opportunity to speak as a part of a panel. Then I thanked my professors, had a few glasses of wine, and went out with E and her friends. I sat in the 1st Ave L station for half an hour waiting for my train home. I had done it. The project was over. Two days later, I officially graduated and held my show where I displayed all 365 of the shirts.",
